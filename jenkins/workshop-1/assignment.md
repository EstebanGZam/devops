## Jenkins Workshop 1

**Installation of Jenkins Controller, Agent, and Script Creation**

**Part One:**

Install a Jenkins controller in a Docker container. Initially, attempt to configure it using the examples from Chapter 2, try to identify the necessary parameters, and practice the creation process.

Subsequently, you can follow the Jenkins website, including the suggested plugins (follow the Docker process for Linux and complete the process up to creating the admin user).

**Part Two:**

1. Install a Jenkins agent and connect it to the Jenkins controller (the agent and the controller must be on the same network). 
2. Access the Jenkins configuration, Nodes. 
3. Create a new node that launches when connected to the controller. 
4. Run the command generated by Jenkins to start and connect the agent.
Optional: Configure the agent as a container: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-agents/

**Part Three:**

1. Create a pipeline item in Jenkins and configure the script using a simple application (e.g., https://github.com/jenkins-docs/simple-java-maven-app). Run the pipeline and review the console.
2. Create a pipeline item in Jenkins and configure the script using GitHub + Maven. Run the pipeline and review the console.
3. Modify the previous script to check if the project already exists; if it does, delete the folder and then download the project again. Run the pipeline and review the console.
4. Add a parameter to Jenkins that allows selecting the branch to be compiled. You can use the `declarative` or `testng` branches available in the example project. Run the pipeline and review the console.
5. Move the previous script to an external file and use the file in the pipeline.
Use console outputs to verify that the folder does not exist and that the correct branch was compiled.

Additionally, you can explore additional plugins and configurations in Jenkins.
